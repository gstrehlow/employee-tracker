- When I choose to view all departments, then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
- When I choose to view all roles, then I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
- When I choose to view all employees, then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
- When I choose to add a department, then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
- When I choose to add a role, then I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
- When I choose to add an employee, then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
- When I choose to update an employee role, then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
